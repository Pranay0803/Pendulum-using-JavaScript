# Pendulum-using-JavaScript
Creating a Pendulum using html and typescript,javascript

This project consists of html file and using typescript to provide event actions to our pendulum.

> Components:
1. HTML file (.html)
2. Typescript file (.ts) for creating elements
3. Typescript file (.ts) for applying the elements on the web page using canvas.
4. tsconfig.json file to converts .ts file to .js file

Here, I have included buttons to swing our pendulum to either left or right or just keep it at rest.
Its a simple project which can be used to create something big and substantial.
